# Imaging in Neuroscience: with a focus on MEG and EEG Methods

Here you find the tutorials for the doctoral course *Imaging in Neuroscience: with a focus on MEG and EEG Methods* at Karolinska Institutet from April 14th to May 3rd.

All tutorials are example of how to analyse MEG/EEG signals. This is not meant as an exhaustive account of how to analyse MEG/EEG data. The material is design to give an overview of different aspects of MEG/EEG data analysis and useable example code on how to do the analysis. 

To run the tutorial you need MATLAB (www.mathworks.com), FieldTrip (www.fieldtriptoolbox.org), and the tutorial data. All tutorials use FieldTrip. To learn more about FieldTrip, we recommend looking at the FieldTrip webpage for documentation and many more tutorial examples.

## Overview

The tutorial for the course is divided in seven parts numbered 01-07. Each part consist of one or more pages:

* tutorial_01a_preprocessing
* tutorial_01b_evoked responses

* tutorial_02_frequencyanalysis
* tutorial_03_prepare_mri
* tutorial_04a_dipole analysis
* tutorial_04b_mne
* tutorial_05_beamformer
* tutorial_06_connectivity
* tutorial_07_statistics

In addition, there is extra tutorials that are not part of the main assignment. They contain tips for writing analysis scripts and example on how to create surface-based source models with Freesurfer (www.freesurfer.net) and import them to FieldTrip

* tutorial_00_tips_for_writing_scripts
* tutorial_99_prepare_mne_sourcespace

## Exam and questions

Thought the tutorials you will find questions like this:

> **Question X.X:** what is an ERP?

For the course  *Imaging in Neuroscience: with a focus on MEG and EEG Methods* your assignment is to answer the questions in a separate text document and submit through Canvas. When you answer the questions, use examples, code, and figures from the exercises.
